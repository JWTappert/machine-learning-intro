The first thing I wanted to know about the data is how _skewed_ it was. I wanted to know the total number of each ethnicity that took the survey so I could understand how _representative_ this census data was of the total population. It didn't take long to realize that this data was not very
representative of the population at all. The vast majority of participants were white, over seventy
five percent in fact. This means that the remaining almost fifteen percent was represented by
over four races. **Figure 1** shows the total number of participants by their race.
